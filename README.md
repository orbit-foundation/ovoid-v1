# Ovoid Markup Language - Version 1.0.0
I am an amateur coder, specialising in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I'm also learning Swift, Xcode, JavaScript and SQL.

**However, I want to branch out, and am working in a markup language designed to help with developing websites and web apps.**

I have researched creating languages and am aware that it takes a Lex and Yacc combination to create the tokens and syntax, but I am an inexperienced developer and am even less experienced with GitHub.

### What I would like to happen
I intend to create a markup language that speeds up the creation of webpages by combining even further CSS, HTML and JS.

**IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HELP PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR INFORMATION OF THE SYNTAX.**
