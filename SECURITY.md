## Reporting a Vulnerability

Any idenitified vulnerabilities of our security systems must be posted as soon as possible as an Issue. Use the **vulnerability** label so we can identify it.
If we deem that it is a vulnerability worth addressing, we will fix it, and post news of it in reply to your Issue.
